# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Formulated a plan for what I will get out of this challenge

**Thoughts:** Ive separated my plan into three main areas; 

1. My blog- i not only need to build this but i aim to document my progress daily, and it will be the focus for my personal study on top of what i will learn as i work on the other two areas. 

2. My Progressive Web App- This is my passion project, i've wanted to learn more about PWA's and how to build them from scratch for about a year now and I have an idea for a project that has not yet been done in Australia. I think this will be a really tough but fun project. 

3. My Portfolio, I plan on building a fun/creative/interactive portfolio that showcases my outgoing personality as well as my skill set (that I aim to aquire by the end of this).

There are also... 

Various toutorials I will complete and document throughout the 100 days, (eg the Kyle S/FrontEndMasters collection)

books I will read and 

languages/frameworks I will learn to use (React, Node, Redux)
